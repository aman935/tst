Tick Stack Toe
The game will have the P1 vs. P2 mode which allows two players to play against each other. The Tick Stack toe game
will let users choose only the coloumn and the symbol, either 'X' or 'O' will get pushed to the stack of the coloumn.
This way, the game will be played on (5*7) board. The one who makes first a diagonal up, diagonal down, horizontal or 
vertical line of four will win. It may so happen that it's a draw. The users can choose to play a tournament of any 
number of boards according to them. It's their choice, for example, if they choose a four game tournament. 
The one who wins maximum of the four games in total will win. You think you figured it out? Let the game decide it 
when you play it with your friend.
